## Some Tips
1. Please remember to cd (change directory) into left-n-go <b>"cd left-n-go"</b> before coding on the app
2. Remember to commit and push up to GitHub upon changes
3. To run the react app on local server, use <b>"npm run start"</b>, it should start in localhost:3000 and you can access it from browser
