Hello

## Trying out from Git
Just trying out 

## Some Tips
1. Please remember to cd (change directory) into left-n-go <b>"cd left-n-go"</b> before coding on the app
2. Remember to commit and push up to GitHub upon changes
3. To run the react app on local server, use <b>"npm run start"</b>, it should start in localhost:3000 and you can access it from browser
4. Personnal, I use ctrl+C to stop the development server.

## If any issues found, can list below with solution
1. "sh: react-scripts: command not found" ,
<b> Use "npm install" again because when we make fresh clone, there will very likely be no node_modules (since these are .gitignore'd).
